# Falcon - the greatest JSON diff#

### What is this about ###

Well, in the end of the day we all work with JSON. One way or another. From time to time we need to have a precise information about what is the difference between two JSONs, right ? Thats basically it ! 

We are using awesome json-diff lib that you can find here:
[json-diff](https://github.com/pkafel/json-diff)

### Lets make it clear ###
* this repo is **just a frontend** (even if with logic) !
* the page will not be called *Falcon* ! It is just a project and repo name...
